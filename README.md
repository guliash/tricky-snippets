# tricky-snippets
A collection of tricky snippets in different languages.

If you want to add a snippet:
1. Create a directory for the language (for example python) if it does not exist
2. Create a directory for the snippet named $username + the number of the snippet$

For example, if you want to add a snippet in python:
1. Go to 'python' directory
2. If it's your third snippet in 'python' directory then it will be called 'python/username3/your_snippet_name.py'

It would be nice to hear your suggestions about the naming conventions.
