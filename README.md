# tricky-snippets
A collection of tricky snippets in different languages.

If you want to add a snippet:

1. Create a directory for the language (for example python) if it does not exist
2. Create a directory for the snippet named $username + very-brief-description + id$

For example, if you want to add a snippet in python:

1. Go to 'python' directory
2. If your snippet is about a tricky inheritance example and it is your third inheritance example then the directory should be named 'python/username-inheritance3/your_snippet_name.py'

It would be nice to hear your suggestions about the naming conventions.
